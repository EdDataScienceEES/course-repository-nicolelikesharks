# **course-repository-nicolelikesharks** Coding Etiquette
### Etiquette for coding, repo structure and file naming:
### Sourced [DataScienceHub2020](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/DataScienceHub2020/blob/master/etiquette.md)

Please read through carefully before you begin using this repository and
familiriarise yourself with the etiquette and then follow it.

1. Create sections and group code thematically.
Create outilne by adding 4 "----" after your headings.

2. Remember to introduce your code - have your title, name, date, contact
details, packages you have used for the specific script.

E.g.
- Title
- Name of author - date
- email@example.com

3. Comment your code using # so that everyone can follow and understand your
code.

4. Have consistent spacing:
- Spaces around logical operators e.g. `<-`, `=`, `==` etc.
- Spaces after commas.
- Inline commenting: two spaces after the code, followed by "#", a single space and then your text.

5. Naming:
- When you name files or folders, don't use spaces, use underscroes `_`.
- For objects, use underscores `_`.
- For functions use a period `.`.
- Use all lowercase letters for both objects and functions.
- Variable names should be nouns and function names should be verbs.

6. Remember to indent code so that it doesn't get too long on one line - limiting to 80-100 characters per line is good.

7. When using pipes from the dplyr package, keep the pipe operator %>% at the
end of the line and continue your pipe on a new line.

8. Similarly, when using ggplot2, keep the + at the end of the line and continue
adding on layers on a new line.

9. Use relative filepaths. Make sure filepaths are short and sensible.
AND make sure scripts are reproducible!

10. Remember to commit, pull, push!
Please add an informative commit message when you make changes e.g. "Gergana edited the etiquette file".

11. If there is a code conflict, don't push until you have decided together with the person you are in conflict with which version to keep.

12. When asking a question, remember to include the error message, your goal and
what you're problems were, what solutions you tried and why they didn't work out.

13. When you are answering a question, remember to give an example that's as
reproducible as possible, for example if your code uses specific packages,
mention them.


--- Most importantly, be CONSISTENT! ---
